To Develop a secure image steganography system to protect data from cyber attacks and enhance data confidentiality and robustness

I developed a secure image steganography system integrating AES-256, RSA encryption, and Randomized LSB techniques to embed confidential data within images imperceptibly. The project provides dual-layer encryption and randomized embedding patterns to ensure resistance against steganalysis attacks while preserving image quality. This robust solution demonstrates advanced cryptographic integration and secure data transmission capabilities, relevant to modern cybersecurity challenges.
